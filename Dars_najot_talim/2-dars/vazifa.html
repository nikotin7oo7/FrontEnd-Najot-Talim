        <br>
        <p align="center">The man who saved a billion lives</p>

        <p align="center">Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 align="center">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <p align="center">
            <b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa
        </p>
        <br>
        <li align="center">
            <b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br>  we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li align="center">
            <b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.
        </li>
        <br>

    </ul>
    <i align="center">"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution <br> that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</i>
